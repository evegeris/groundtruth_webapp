// feature requests and other notes
// from final 41X design meeting
// additional development for groundtruthing app

- 256x256 imgs

- crop option: no crop

- allow login through Google and GitHub
(restrict eg. Google auth to certain domains)
* Note that we still need to be able to associate users with images,
* so we'll still need to have a users table with entries for everyone.
* Letting people login through another domain is nice though, convenient.

- note on segmentation screen that CTrl+Z undos previous action

- change 'bad data' to 'unclassified'

- update 'finish' operation: form dictionary as user classifying

- function to convert JSON to 2d array for dhanesh

- allow user tomodify boundaries on classification
- eg. select segment to apply k-means to resegment or manually draw

I'm going to need to log off in a minute, so just typing up a couple of points:
1. Try to move forward on the features/bug fixes we discussed today, knock off as many of these as possible
2. Work with Justin to get the labeler into the hands of a "professional" labeler, and try to label, e.g. 20-100 images to get their feedback
